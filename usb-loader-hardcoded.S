# This function address was discovered by disassembling the ROM, which
# begins around offset 0xfff00000.  When the MTK Flash Tool loads code into
# an unflashed MTK chip, it makes calls to a few well-defined positions that
# contain pointers to read a buffer, write a buffer, and flush the current
# write buffer.  The programming interface is the same for both USB and
# serial.  However, since the MT6260 series of parts primarily boots
# off of USB, we are only interested in the USB thunks.
# The prototype for this function is:
#	void usb_uart_read(void *buffer, int bytes, int timeout)
	ldr	r3, =0xfff03639
	blx	r3

	ldr	r1, size_buffer

# r1 now contains the number of bytes to load.
# r0 contains the current offset to write to.
# Load bytes from the serial port into RAM.
